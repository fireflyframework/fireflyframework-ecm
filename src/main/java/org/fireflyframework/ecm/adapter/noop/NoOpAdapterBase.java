/**
 * Base class for no-op adapter implementations that provides common logging functionality.
 *
 * <p>This class serves as the foundation for all no-op adapters in the ECM system.
 * No-op adapters are used as fallbacks when no real adapter implementations are
 * available, allowing the application to start successfully while providing clear
 * feedback about missing functionality.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key features:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Consistent warning logging when methods are invoked</li>
 *   <li>Standardized error messages for missing functionality</li>
 *   <li>Support for graceful degradation patterns</li>
 * </ul>

/**
 * Processing status enumeration for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) operations.
 * 
 * <p>This enumeration defines the various states that a document processing request
 * can be in during its lifecycle. It provides a standardized way to track the
 * progress of IDP operations across different adapters and implementations.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The processing lifecycle typically follows this flow:</p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>PENDING:</strong> Request submitted but not yet started</li>
 *   <li><strong>PROCESSING:</strong> Active processing in progress</li>
 *   <li><strong>COMPLETED:</strong> Processing finished successfully</li>
 *   <li><strong>FAILED:</strong> Processing encountered an error</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Additional states handle special cases like cancellation, validation,
 * and partial completion scenarios.</p>
